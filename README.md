# SuiteValue.UI.Metro

SuiteValue.UI.Metro is a framework targeting WinRT XAML/C# Metro development, and it helps develop various tasks common for Metro apps.
## What’s in the Box

1.  Fully pluggable and open providers system for authentications. It wraps around WebAuthenticationBroker and offers common user info details from each service. Out of the box support for Google, Facebook, Twitter and LiveID.
2.  Very simple and naive implementation of Time and Date pickers.
3.  BaseViewModels which help navigation and async scenarios. 


## Using the framework

There are nuget packages you can consume that will help you get started.
Also Samples are available, as of now, a sample for using the Time/Date Pickers exists to your leisure. More samples are expected to be added soon.
